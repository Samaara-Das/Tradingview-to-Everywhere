🎯 GOAL: send tradingview chart images (with sl/tp lines of a specific entry on a specific chart) to twitter


🤔 HOW DO WE DO IT:

in order to post the screenshot, 

1. 🟢 recieve signals from the screener. it will tell whether there are buy/sell signals and on what chart and timeframe.
   1. 🟢 get the data thru alerts on tradingview. scrape the tradingview chart for the alert. get the data from the alert
   2. 🟢 make sure that in pinescript, the alert is only showing those entries which have just closed or just opened. Also, remove the table, its just eating up space. check if the alerts are showing the correct information.
   (so that we can know which charts to open)
   3. 🟢 double check whether its giving correct info in the alert

   OR 

   in python, keep track of what trades just opened and what trades just closed


2. 🟢 get the entry data in the alert
   🟢 structure the code and the modules correctly (add the code for the open_tv file)
   🟢 go to the chart and the timeframe which has that new entry 
      🟢 remove the screener on the chart only once & make the chart position look nice
      🟢 add a new indicator to the chart only once (the one which will draw tp/sl lines)
      🟢 go to the new symbol and timeframe (optimize the change tf method so that it only changes if the current timeframe is different than the wanted timeframe)
   🟠 get the exit data too and go to the chart. we're not getting the closed sell/closed buy part of the alert. fix this in the read_alert function

3. 🟠 for an exit, show that that price is touching the tp in the green part
      🟢 make an indicator which will draw the long/short position on the chart given the price & time inputs

4. 🟢 take a snapshot of it and post to twitter (try to use the tweepy library)
   🟢 get the entry, sl, entry price data from the alert
   🟢 when on that entry's chart, enter the entry price, sl & tp into the indicator
   after that, take a snapshot
      🟢 get the entry, sl, entry price data from the alert
      🟢 double click on indicator and enter the tp,sl and entry. asked question on stack overflow & discord:

      🟢 make sure the tp, sl & entry are correct when inputting them in the settings
      🟢 after going to every chart, make sure that the last long/short position has been removed so that when we draw a new one, the last one won't show
      🟢 draw tp, sl, entry labels with their price
      🟢 when inputting the sl, entry & tp, also input the type of entry i.e. Buy or Sell. do this in pytohn and pinescript
      🟢 update script changes to drive
      🟢 once we have changed the indicator settings, call a method to get the link of the chart. then call the twitter class. pass in the text (Buy in EURUSD at 1.0932) with link of the chart.

5. 🟡 store that snapshot and other info in a database
      🟢 get the url from the newly opened tab. wait for the page to fully load by checking the img element is present. then take the url and close the tab
      🟢 make sure it gets the url of the chart for all the messges in the alert and doesn't stop after the 1st one
      🟢 learn how to debug
      🟡 stress test the number of pairs and tabs (optimize the pinescript script if possible... ask people how i can improve it)
      🟠 test the db out by printing the last row of the db. get the row which is the latest
      🟢 change the premium screener source code to remove the lines and update on drive

6. 🔴 finishing touches
      🔴 make sure it can send tweets on behalf of other accounts. have a developer portal with those sccounts. create new keys & secrets.

      🔴 after changing the indicator settings in the read_alert method in get_alert_data.py, make sure the chart fully loads with the new indicator settings before it takes a screenshot. so that when it takes a screenshot, the screenshot has the updated symbol, tf & indicator settings

      🔴 structure the code

      🔴 add documentation:
