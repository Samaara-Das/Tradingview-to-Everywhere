🎯 GOAL: send tradingview chart images (with sl/tp lines of a specific entry on a specific chart) to twitter


❓I have asked for help on stack overflow & on the discord pinescript server
link to the stack overflow question:

🤔 HOW DO WE DO IT:

🗒️ these are the steps needed to accomplish this. not programmatic steps but mini goals which add up to accomplish the bigger goal


in order to post the screenshot, 

1. ask nishant uncle

1. 🟡 recieve signals from the screener. it will tell whether there are buy/sell signals and on what chart and timeframe.
   1. get the data thru alerts on tradingview. scrape the tradingview chart for the alert. get the data from the alert

2. to have a chart where pinescript draws the tp/sl lines, just draw lines in the screener script.
