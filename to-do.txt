🎯 GOAL: send tradingview chart images (with sl/tp lines of a specific entry on a specific chart) to twitter


❓I have asked for help on stack overflow & on the discord pinescript server
link to the stack overflow question:

🤔 HOW DO WE DO IT:

🗒️ these are the steps needed to accomplish this. not programmatic steps but mini goals which add up to accomplish the bigger goal


in order to post the screenshot, 

1. 🟢 recieve signals from the screener. it will tell whether there are buy/sell signals and on what chart and timeframe.
   1. 🟢 get the data thru alerts on tradingview. scrape the tradingview chart for the alert. get the data from the alert
   2. 🟡 make sure that in pinescript, the alert is only showing those entries which have just closed or just opened. Also, remove the table, its just eating up space. check if the alerts are showing the correct information.
   (so that we can know which charts to open)

   OR 

   in python, keep track of what trades just opened and what trades just closed


2. after getting the data in the alert (about the new trade), go to the chart and the timeframe which has that new entry

3. take a snapshot of it and post to twitter

4. store that snapshot and other info in a database
