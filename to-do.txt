游꿢 GOAL: send tradingview chart images (with sl/tp lines of a specific entry on a specific chart) to twitter


仇뉼 have asked for help on stack overflow & on the discord pinescript server
link to the stack overflow question:

游뱂 HOW DO WE DO IT:


in order to post the screenshot, 

1. 游릭 recieve signals from the screener. it will tell whether there are buy/sell signals and on what chart and timeframe.
   1. 游릭 get the data thru alerts on tradingview. scrape the tradingview chart for the alert. get the data from the alert
   2. 游릭 make sure that in pinescript, the alert is only showing those entries which have just closed or just opened. Also, remove the table, its just eating up space. check if the alerts are showing the correct information.
   (so that we can know which charts to open)
   3. 游릭 double check whether its giving correct info in the alert

   OR 

   in python, keep track of what trades just opened and what trades just closed


2. 游릭 get the entry data in the alert
   游리 structure the code and the modules correctly (add the code for the open_tv file)
   游댮 go to the chart and the timeframe which has that new entry 
   游 get the exit data too and go to the chart. we're not getting the closed sell/closed buy part of the alert. fix this in the read_alert function

3. 游댮 (atleast do the entry part) for an entry show tp, sl line with shading (use pinescript indicator). for an exit, show that same thing but make sure that price is touching the tp

4. 游댮 take a snapshot of it and post to twitter (try to use the tweepy library)

5. 游댮 store that snapshot and other info in a database

6. 游댮 optimize:
   try to login to tradingview without having to sign in. make sure it automatically logs in (use cookies)
