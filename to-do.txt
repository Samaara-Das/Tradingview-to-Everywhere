🎯 GOAL: send tradingview chart images (with sl/tp lines of a specific entry on a specific chart) to twitter

HOW DO WE DO IT:

🗒️ write down the steps needed to accomplish this. not programmatic steps but mini goals which add up to accomplish the bigger goal


in order to post the screenshot, 
1. take a screenshot and send it to twitter. 

2. send the screenshot when an entry happens. 
a new entry has to trigger it to do 1. when an entry happens, do no. 1

3. open a chart which has that specified entry's timeframe & symbol so that
it can take a screenshot of that particular chart

4. 🟡 the pinescript indicator has to draw the tp/sl lines on that specific chart
   a. 🟡 write script which copies what the screener does except that it does it for just the current chart
   b. we will be doing this on this script: Premium Screener for 1 chart



📒 TO DOs:

2. 🟡 it has to take screenshots when there is an entry on the current chart. 
   know when to take a screenshot and where to take a screenshot.    
      a. something shud let the system know that a screenshot shud be taken. once it knows, open the chart where the entry is. the sl/tp lines 
      shud be there along with their labels
      b. how does python know that there is a signal and on which timeframe and which symbol

3. 🔴 the script/indicator has to run on all symbols and their timeframes so that it can draw tp/sl lines for each of their trade's
symbol.

4. 🔴 store all images and their attributes (timeframe, symbol, signal) in an sql database
