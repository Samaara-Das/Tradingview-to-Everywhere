# Tradingview screenshots to twitter

## This is a work in progress...

This project is for Poolsifi. This will send screenshots of charts (where an entry happened) to Twitter.
Something will notify it that a screenshot has to be taken.

NOTES:

- please use the nili.thp.work gmail id to login to tradingview as the chart on that account has been set up in a specific way
- do not copy anything to the clipboard... it is using the clipboard to retrieve things which are being copied to the clipboard
